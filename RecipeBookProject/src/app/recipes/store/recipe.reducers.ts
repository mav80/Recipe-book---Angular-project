      '2.  ADD MEAT. Add sausage and all meat, mixing and browning.  If you need more fat, add olive oil. You do not want to over cook the meat, just brown on the outside.  If you use good smoked Polish sausage, you do not need to brown very long.\n' +

      '4.  ADD REST OF INGREDIENTS. Put all ingredients together in your large pot, but not the prunes. If there is not enough room, add the cabbage first to reduce it a little. \n' +

      '5.  SAUTÃ‰ FOR 2 TO 3 HOURS ON LOW.  Cook until you reduce the liquid and it becomes more of a thick stew. Mix every 20 minutes or so and make sure it is not dry. You can add more red wine or broth if needed. Bigos should always be juicy. Taste, but it will not have the flavor until the next day.  But, you can add more paprika or pepper. \n' +
